This repository contains my completed solutions for Lab 2: Practicing Implementation with Frontend Mentor.

In this lab, I worked on two Frontend Mentor challenges:  
1. QR Code Component
2. Blog Preview Card

Both challenges helped me practice writing clean, semantic HTML and responsive CSS that closely match Figma design specifications.
